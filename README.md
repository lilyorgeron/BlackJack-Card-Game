# BlackJack-Card-Game

--------------------

# INTRODUCTION

--------------------

This Blackjack game was created as a milestone project for the Udemy Complete Python Bootcamp. 
Its purpose is to emmulate a game of Blackjack through the Jupyter Notebook interface.


# REQUIREMENTS

--------------------

Jupyter Notebook with Python capabilities (https://jupyter.org/install)


# INSTALLATION

--------------------

Simply download and open through Jupyter Notebook.


# USAGE

--------------------

Once the program is opened in Jupyter Notebook, be sure to run each cell from top to bottom in order to activate all the code needed.
When the final cell is run, the Blackjack game will begin. The game will ask how many chips the user would like to bet, and the user should respond with a number below 100.
Each time the player has a turn, the player will be asked if they want to "hit," meaning to draw another card, or to "stay," passing the chance to draw another card. 
The player's goal is to reach a score of 21 (without going above 21) before the dealer can reach a score of 17. If the player wins, the chips they bet are added to their total. 
If the player loses, they "bust," the chips are subtracted from their total. The game keeps track of the player's chips as long as the user keeps playing.
After a game is finished, the user will be asked to play again, to which they can respond "yes" or "no".
